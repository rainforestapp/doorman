  "readme": "# Ember for Node\n\nEmber.js is a framework for building ambitious client-side applications on the\nweb. Now you can use the same Ember tools in node code and in node-based asset\npipelines like [Convoy](http://github.com/charlesjolley/convoy).\n\n# Using This Package\n\nJust add ember as a requirement to your package.json:\n\n```javascript\n\"dependencies\": {\n  ...\n  \"ember\": \"~0.9\"\n}\n```\n\nIn your code, you can load the entire Ember stack by just requiring the package.\nThis will add Ember to the global namespace in your application.\n\n```javascript\nrequire('ember');\n\nMyApp = Ember.Application.create({\n  hi: function() { console.log('Hi! I'm an app!'); }\n});\n```\n\nIf you don't want to use the entire Ember stack, you can just require the \nspecific module that you want. For example, a lot of server side code just \nneeds States for statecharting:\n\n```javascript\nrequire('ember/states');\n\nMyState = Ember.State.create({\n  \n});\n```\n\n# Using Ember with Convoy\n\nBuilding an Ember application in the browser is very easy when using Convoy.\nJust require ember in your main application file.\n\n```javascript\n// In some JS module included by convoy:\nrequire('ember'); // <- convoy will automatically pull in all of Ember.\n\nUserView = Ember.View.extend({\n  template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('{{firstName}} {{lastName}}')\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to store your Handlebars templates in a separate file, Ember for\nNode has a HandlebarsCompiler that will precompile the templates for you. \nHere is an example Convoy pipeline configuration:\n\n```javascript\npipeline = convoy({\n  'app.js': {\n    packager: 'javascript',\n    compilers: {\n      '.hbr': require('ember/packager').HandlebarsCompiler\n    }\n  }\n});\n\napp = express.createServer();\napp.use(pipeline.middleware());\n```\n\nThis will now make `.hbr` files available as modules. In your app code, you\ncan load the template via a normal require:\n\n```javascript\n// user_view.js\n\nrequire('ember/views');\n\nUserView = Ember.View.extend({\n  template: require('./user_template') // template in user_template.hbr\n});\n```\n\nFor a fully functioning example of an application, check out the \n[examples](https://github.com/charlesjolley/node-ember/tree/master/examples) \nfolder.\n\n# Building From Source\n\nThis project checks out the ember source and builds compiled copies for use in the released version. If you want to rebuild this from source, here is what you need to do:\n\n1.  Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and Jake installed globally. Once\n    you have node.js installed you can install jake with the command\n    `[sudo] npm install -g jake` \n2.  Also make sure you have Ruby 1.9.3 or later installed as well as bundler. Once\n    you have ruby installed you can install bundler with `[sudo] gem install bundler`\n3.  Clone [the node-ember repo](http://github.com/charlesjolley/node-ember)\n4.  From the repo directory run `jake vendor:setup`. This should checkout the correct \n    versions of ember and ember-data and set them up to build\n5.  Run `jake diet` to actually build the assets.\n\nNote that you only need to run `vendor:setup` once the first time you install the report or anytime the version of ember or ember-data changes. Afterwards, you should be able to run `dist` just to rebuild.\n\nember and ember-data are linked into this project as git submodules. To update to a newer (or older) version of ember or ember-data, cd into the vendor directory and checkout the version you want. Then cd back to the top level of the repo and commit the updates into git. Once completed, run `jake vendor:setup` again to update the contents.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The dist command will checkout whichever version of ember or ember-data are set in the submodule, so you must commit to git before rebuilding.\n\n\n\n",
